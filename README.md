# How YOU Doin?

In this activity, I built a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application that matches users up based on their survey answers. This full-stack site takes in results from users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

### I used:
* Express
* Node.js
* Body-Parser
* Heroku
